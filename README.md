Pathway for Transforming Regional Health

ReThink Health and The Fannie E. Rippel Foundation.

Purpose of this project is to educate and inform.


The Pathway helps leaders and teams better assess and drive progress toward a healthy health system—one where collaborative efforts help individuals, families, and businesses thrive and multi–sector approaches assure that high-quality, affordable care is available when and where we need it. Built on well-grounded complex system change principles that characterize common limits to growth and success, the Pathway offers insights into five stages of development. It focuses on those conditions that can contribute to momentum, and the forces that can disrupt progress. These tend to cluster around three areas:

Level of demand for change by those involved, 
Capacity—human, financial, and organizational—for continued action, and
Alignment among individual interests and the success of the effort.

As a core tool for ReThink Health, the Pathway helps leaders and teams see that both success and problems can be within their control, and understand how progress often breeds the next level of challenges. Points of transition are critical moments of opportunity to foster greater momentum and tackle emergent challenges.

The ReThink Health Pathway begins when leaders step outside of their own organizational boundaries to work more collaboratively with others. The first phase is typically a single focused campaign. Yet absent a long-term and broad-scope vision for system redesign, campaigns alone rarely lead to wider systemic change. Moving through the five phases, leaders typically experience cycles within and between phases, and may find that different parts of a regional effort are in different phases at the same time. The Pathway helps leaders understand what’s involved in the long journey to system redesign, and see the critical roles of stewardship, strategy, investment, and financing along the way.

The Pathway presents the definitions, characteristics, the typical pitfalls of each phase, as well as the approaches and processes that will sustain momentum and collaboration toward the vision of a healthy health system.


The current model is not engaging and does not highlight the impact and intensity of this model. Through the framework of D3, an interactive model will be made to express and inform the reader to stepping stones of success.

This model will create a interactive and engaging interface by which the user can self educate and engage with the pathway.
